# AtaxxGUI
GUI to play Ataxx against a human or computer

###Features
So far there is no support to play against an engine or time controls

###Use
Compile the code (this needs the use of the [qt go binding](https://github.com/therecipe/qt) and go itself). You may need to install qt5 in your computer.

$ `./main /home/name/go/AtaxxGUI-master`

Where the first argument has to be the path to the directory, this is to ensure the sprites are loaded. I'm working in including the images directly into the binary.
